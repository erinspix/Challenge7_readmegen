## Description

This project is a Node.js-based application that generates a professional `README.md` file for your projects. It utilizes the Inquirer package to prompt users with questions about their project details, then dynamically creates a structured and informative README file based on the responses. The generated README file is saved to the `readme-output` directory, ensuring that it is neatly organized.
